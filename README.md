This scrapper is being developed just for didactic purposes and automating the process of collecting google images images to test convolutional neural networks.

The elementary idea is to call a function by passing as parameters a class and a quantity of desired images that will at first be limited uppermost.

As a result of this function, the scrapper will create a folder with the name of the class and all the images inside it
